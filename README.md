# Oklahoma Quakes

#### Project Idea for MAT 400  
I did not end pursuing this project, instead I chose to look a wild fires; see [US WildFires](https://github.com/andrewdnolan/US_WildFires)

This project is using the  [Oklahoma Earthquakes and Saltwater Injection Wells](https://www.kaggle.com/ksuchris2000/oklahoma-earthquakes-and-saltwater-injection-wells#InjectionWells.csv) dataset from Kaggle. Initial steps will be exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, distance calculations. Eventually, I will examine the relationship earthquakes and injection well activity, the relationship between quake magnitude and proximity to well, psi, and surrounding geology.


### To Do:  
- [x] geology extraction  
- [ ] data cleaning  
- [ ] visualization / exploratory data analysis  
- [ ] distance calculations  
- [ ] correlation b/w quakes and injection  
- [ ] correlation b/w magnitude and psi
